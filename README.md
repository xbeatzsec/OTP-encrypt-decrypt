Python script to encrypt and decrypt with One Time Pad algorithm

--------------------------------

I used this script for school use, where I explained the whole One time pad encryption / decryption algorithm, and then
I launched this script to demonstrate with more hands-on how it works.

-----------------------------------

# Instructions



## First you need to install the right packages to run this script without problems.

```pip3 install onetimepad```

```sudo apt-get install python3-pil python3-pil.imagetk```

```sudo apt-get install python3-tk```

### Then you just need to run the script

```python3 otp_app.py```

```chmod +x otp_app.py``` and then ```./otp_app.py```

You will see a output like this one:

And then you just need to write your message / text and write your key to encrypt this message / text.

And then will open up a UI with boxes to insert your text and you just need to encrypt or decrypt that.

Something like this:
